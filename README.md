# Test Repository (a.k.a. The Secret GitHub Playground)

This repository was my private sandbox for experimenting with various GitHub Actions workflows. It’s where I tested, broke, fixed, and refined the pipelines before they were polished enough for the main project. Think of it as the backstage workshop where all the messy magic happens — absolutely essential, but definitely not meant for public viewing.

If you’re curious, feel free to explore the **successful workflow runs** in the **Actions** tab to see how the pipeline evolved behind the scenes.
